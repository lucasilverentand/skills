# Observability Skills

Skills for monitoring, logging, and debugging production applications.

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [logging-setup](./logging-setup/) | Structured logging configuration |
| [error-tracking](./error-tracking/) | Error monitoring with Sentry and alternatives |
| [metrics-collection](./metrics-collection/) | Application metrics and dashboards |
| [tracing](./tracing/) | Distributed tracing setup |

## Usage

```
/logging-setup                 # Configure structured logging
/error-tracking                # Set up error monitoring
/metrics-collection            # Implement application metrics
/tracing                       # Add distributed tracing
```

## Observability Pillars

- **Logs** - Event records for debugging
- **Metrics** - Numerical measurements over time
- **Traces** - Request flow across services

## Supported Tools

- Sentry (error tracking)
- Pino/Winston (logging)
- OpenTelemetry (tracing)
- Prometheus (metrics)
- Grafana (visualization)
