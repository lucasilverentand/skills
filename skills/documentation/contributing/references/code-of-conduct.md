# Code of Conduct Reference

## Contributor Covenant v2.1 (recommended)

The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) is the most widely adopted code of conduct for open-source projects. Use it as the default.

### Setup

1. Download from https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/code_of_conduct.md
2. Save as `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` in the repo root
3. Replace `[INSERT CONTACT METHOD]` with the enforcement contact
4. Link from CONTRIBUTING.md and README.md

### Sections to customize

#### Enforcement contact

Must be a real, monitored email address or alias. Never leave the placeholder.

Good: `conduct@example.com`, `maintainer@example.com`
Bad: `[INSERT CONTACT METHOD]`, personal email rarely checked

#### Scope

The default covers project spaces and public representation. Customize if needed:

- **Project spaces only**: interactions in the repo, issues, PRs, discussions
- **Extended scope**: conferences, social media when representing the project
- **Organization-wide**: all repos under the org share one code of conduct

#### Enforcement guidelines

The Covenant provides 4 levels:

| Level | Action | When |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Correction** | Private written warning, explanation of violation | First minor offense |
| **2. Warning** | Formal warning with consequences for continued behavior | Repeated minor or first moderate offense |
| **3. Temporary Ban** | Temporary ban from community interaction | Serious violation or pattern of behavior |
| **4. Permanent Ban** | Permanent removal from all community spaces | Sustained pattern or egregious violation |

Adjust these if the project has different norms (e.g., smaller communities may only need 2 levels).

## Minimal Code of Conduct (small projects)

For small or internal projects where the full Covenant feels heavy:

```markdown
# Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and respectful environment for everyone.

## Expected behavior
- Be respectful and constructive in discussions
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully
- Focus on what is best for the project and community

## Unacceptable behavior
- Harassment, trolling, or personal attacks
- Publishing others' private information without consent
- Any conduct that would be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement
Violations can be reported to [maintainer@example.com]. All reports will be reviewed and investigated. Maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject contributions that violate this code.
```

## Enforcement Process

When a report comes in:

1. **Acknowledge** receipt within 24 hours
2. **Review** the report — gather context, check history
3. **Decide** on action using the enforcement guidelines
4. **Communicate** the decision to the reporter and the offender
5. **Document** the incident privately (not publicly)
6. **Follow up** after 30 days to ensure the situation is resolved

### Documentation

Keep a private log of incidents (not in the repo). Track:
- Date of report
- Summary of behavior
- Action taken
- Follow-up status
